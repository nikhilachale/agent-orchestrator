// SuggestedInstallCommand returns the recommended npm command for installing
// DeepSeek Harness. It is not part of any interface and exists only so docs
// and tests can reference a single canonical install string.
//
// Notes for users:
//   - Node 20 or newer is required by `@deepseek-ai/dsh`.
//   - `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh` may time out on the first invocation while the
//     dependency graph is resolved; a pre-installed global CLI is faster and
//     is what the runtime expects to find on PATH.
//   - DeepSeek Harness is a developer preview; the upstream maintainers warn
//     that breaking changes are expected before GA.

	return "npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh"
