// Recovery for spawns the daemon did not finish.
//
// A spawn is a sequence of side effects — a row, a worktree, provisioning,
// attachments, a provider process — and a crash or a cancelled request can land
// between any two of them. The durable spawn phase says which of those side
// effects are real, and this file turns that into the one safe action:
//
//	preparing, no workspace   nothing outside the row exists; drop the seed
//	preparing, with workspace an older build's row; treat it as workspace_ready
//	workspace_ready           the worktree is the user's; reopen it and start
//	                          the agent fresh, replaying the original prompt
//	controller_ready          a controller identity was committed; the ordinary
//	                          native-resume path owns this session
//
// The one thing recovery must never do is resume natively from a spawn that
// never committed a controller: there is no provider conversation to resume,
// and pretending otherwise either fails obscurely or silently drops the user's
// original prompt.

// recoverInterruptedSpawnIfNeeded handles a session whose spawn never reached
// controller_ready. handled=false means the session is fully spawned and the
// caller's ordinary path applies.
